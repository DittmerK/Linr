## Introduction

Welcome To Linr

Linr is a new program for stage managers to track and distribute line notes across multiple productions. Maintain cast lists, repeat offensives, and more for multiple shows all from one program.

The software is simple to use. Create a show, fill out cast information, and input your email settings. You're now ready to input information about line notes as they happen. If a new note looks like a previous note, the software will automatically flag it for you. You can then choose to either input it as a new note, or increase the "occurences" count on the old note instead.

At the end of the day, send cast members their line notes from that day with the click of a button. Get home sooner with Linr.

Currently only available on windows.
